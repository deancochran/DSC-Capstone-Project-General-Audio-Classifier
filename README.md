# DSC-Capstone-Project-General-Audio-Classifier
In this project our goal is to build a general audio classifier capable of recognising different sounds. The Sounds will be ambient noises from an urban environment like sirens traffic noises and construction.  The purpose of this project is to understand the intricacies of sound, and what makes similar sounds different. Many people can readily recognise common sounds, for instance a dog bark, but people can identify these sounds only after theyâ€™ve learned the characteristics of each sound, after they have heard it through their entire life.  I want to work with DSP (Digital Signal Processing) after college and this project serves as a way for me to be introduced into the field. Understanding how a singal is processed if fundamental to understanding how speech recognition, music, and audio prediction can be made.
