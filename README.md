# DSC-Capstone-Project-General-Audio-Classifier

Welcome to my Data Science Seminar Project on creating a general audio classifier

In this project our goal is to build a general audio classifier capable of recognising different sounds. The Sounds will be ambient noises from an urban environment like sirens traffic noises and construction.  The purpose of this project is to understand the intricacies of sound, and what makes similar sounds different. Many people can readily recognise common sounds, for instance a dog bark, but people can identify these sounds only after they’ve learned the characteristics of each sound, after they have heard it through their entire life.  I want to work with DSP (Digital Signal Processing) after college and this project serves as a way for me to be introduced into the field. Understanding how a singal is processed if fundamental to understanding how speech recognition, music, and audio prediction can be made.

Things to know before opening the “My Project” folder:

1.	Paths are very important to this project
a.	Please do not move anything, you should only have access to view but in the case that you can edit, don’t move anything

2.	The path of the “DSC 500 Seminar Project” folder is very important as well
a.	Make sure you read through the Workbook #1 to verify that the folder is in the correct directory before you run any code

3.	If you do want to run the code be aware of some pitfalls
a.	The run time for workbook #1 takes a few hours and should only be run if you want to rebalance or alter the methods of feature extraction
b.	The tuning of hyperparameters of the feedforward neural network will require you to uncomment and add additional code if you wish to GridSearch through more combinations of parameters

4.	To begin the project simply open up the workbook #1 and run the code

5.	Follow this up by opening up the workbook #2 once #1 is finished and run that as well

6.	If you have access to this folder, congratulations you go to Centre College and are using a Centre College email which is require to use anything in this folder

7.	If you don’t wish to run the code, feel free to take a look at this awesome seminar project
